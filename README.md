ColourTheWorldApp will be a complex desktop application which let users create their own colouring books based on saved pictures. 
The selected photo will have its lines detected and then thanks to negating colours, it will be transformed into a colouring book. 
  
 The project was created to practise Java, JavaFX and Maven.
